# Colab-demo

Repo for Colab friendly notebooks of Data 8 for Demonstration Purposes.

All assignments have been converted to use the [Otter Grader](https://otter-grader.readthedocs.io/). If you are an instructor looking to teach Data 8 at your institution, please feel free to contact us at [ds-help@berkeley.edu](mailto:ds-help@berkeley.edu).


## Downloading Submissions

Unfortunately, the "click here to download" link in the last `grader.export` cell for submission does not work. 
While the submission will be successfully exported, the download link does not match. 
Instead, you will have to navigate using the file explorer (either through the left side bar of Colab) or through google drive to download the generated submission zip export.
